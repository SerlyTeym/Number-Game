## ‚ú® Getting Started
- [Recommended tutorial](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab) that walks you through how to install and setup Flutter, as well as the basics of Flutter/Dart
- Preferred IDE [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio.) 
  - Open Android Studio, go to "Configure" > "Plugins," and install the Flutter and Dart plugins.
- Either [Github Studio](https://desktop.github.com/) or [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- Verify Flutter installation by running

  ```

## üìö Useful Resources
- [Flutter Documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/) Tutorials, examples, and docs for reference
- [Cookbook](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook) Useful Flutter samples
- [Learn the basics of Git and GitHub](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Dd7KRpKeaE) 
- [Learn how to read/use a Kanban board](https://kanbanize.com/kanban-resources/getting-started/what-is-kanban-board)

## üëæ Creating a Feature Branch
- View the Kanban board located in the Projects tab in this repo
- Members are expected to complete around 1-2 tasks per week, however the timeline is flexible based on size/priority and your experience with Flutter
- Add yourself as an asignee to a task you would like to complete
- [Create your own branch](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository) from the main repo, and clone it into your local computer. Please include your name in the branch. 
- Your IDE may ask you to run commands such as `flutter pub get`
- Ensure your branch is up to date with the main repository by merging main into your branch 
- Delete your branch once it is merged into main 
###Make your contributions!!! Implement features!!! Fix bugs!!!!###

## üì≤ Code Merge Guidelines
- Once you have finished making changes, run unit tests(IN PROGRESS) to ensure your code does not introduce any new issues.
- Once you are satisfied with your changes, you are ready to [commit](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/making-changes-in-a-branch/committing-and-reviewing-changes-to-your-project-in-github-desktop) your changes onto your remote branch (Make sure you commit to your branch and not to main!) 
- Please leave useful comments about your changes in your commit
- Push the commit into your branch (Note: you can always REVERT or a commit)
- Before your branch is merged to the main repository, create a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) of your branch
- Ask someone to view your branch, modify code if you've received feedback
- (if you are the person reviewing someone else's code, please review it carefully by spending at least 5 min: running the code, looking at the commits and changes in the files)
- The person who creates the branch is responsible for merging it to main once it has received approval
- Hooray! Your code is now officially published!
